# battery-charging-circuit
Thus circuit is for the purpose of charging ann Li-ion battery for operating motors in a robot. 
Although the cost of Li-ion batteries are just slightly high, Li-ion is best for robots due to the following properties:
1. Light weight
2. portable 
3. long-lasting - typical Li-ion battery lasts for about 2-3 years
Nominal voltage of Li-ion: 3.6V approx.
C rating: 3000mAh approx.
The circuit uses LM7805 IC, diodes, NPN transistor and other basic components
